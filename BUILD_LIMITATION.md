# ⚠️ Build Limitation - XAML Compiler Issue

## 🚫 Cannot Build via Command Line

**Error:** XAML Compiler requires Visual Studio 2022

**Reason:** WinUI 3 XAML files need Visual Studio's XAML compiler which is not available in command line dotnet build.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Visual Studio 2022 Required

### **Why Visual Studio is Needed:**
- WinUI 3 uses advanced XAML compilation
- XAML Compiler (XamlCompiler.exe) needs Visual Studio environment
- Command line build fails at XAML compilation step

### **What You Need to Do:**

1. **Install Visual Studio 2022**
   - Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
   - Install "Desktop development with C++" workload
   - Install ".NET Desktop Development" workload

2. **Open Project**
   ```
   Double-click: RajCam.sln
   ```

3. **Build**
   ```
   Press: Ctrl+Shift+B
   Or: Build → Build Solution
   ```

4. **Get EXE**
   ```
   Location: RajCam\bin\x64\Release\net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\RajCam.exe
   ```

## 📝 Note:

This is a limitation of WinUI 3 framework, not the code.
